# On-Premise Asynchronous Transcription and Open-Source Diarization Tools

## On-Premise Solution
This repository provides a local, self-hosted solution for asynchronous transcription, enabling users to convert audio files into text without relying on external cloud services. The transcription service processes audio files asynchronously, allowing users to manage transcription tasks locally on their own infrastructure. This setup ensures complete control over data privacy and security, making it an ideal choice for users who require transcription capabilities without the need for internet connectivity or cloud dependencies.

## Open-Source Tools
In addition to the on-premise transcription solution, this repository includes a set of open-source tools for working with both transcription and speaker diarization. These tools enable advanced workflows, allowing users to differentiate between speakers in multi-participant audio files. With flexible configurations and compatibility with various formats, the open-source code offers a powerful solution for organizations looking to implement speaker identification and manage complex transcription tasks.
