# Self-Hosted Asynchronous and Live Transcription

## Self-Hosted Solution
This repository provides a local, self-hosted solution for asynchronous and live transcription, enabling users to convert audio files into text without relying on external cloud services.[^1] The transcription service allows users to manage transcription tasks locally on their own infrastructure. This setup is ideal for users who require complete control over data privacy and security.

[^1]: The transcription services require communication with two endpoints owned by Rev to operate: `https://api.rev.ai/external/v2open/initialize` and `https://api.rev.ai/external/v2open/billing`.
